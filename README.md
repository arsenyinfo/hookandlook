# HookAndLook ðŸŽ£

`hookandlook` is a tool helping to gather stats and run checks during training deep learning models with Pytorch.

Features:

- Storing stats for input and output of a model or its blocks;
- Stats visualization with tensorboard;
- Model sanity checks as hooks (see `hookandlook.hooks`);

Checks collection is far from complete, contributions are very welcome.

## Installation

`pip install hookandlook`

or

`pip install git+https://github.com/arsenyinfo/hookandlook`

## Usage

```python
from hookandlook.watch import Wrapper
from hookandlook import hooks

model = MyTorchModel()

# simplest wrapper
model = Wrapper.wrap_model(model)

# or with additional selected hooks
check_positive = hooks.forward_hook_check_value_in_range(min_value=0)
check_train_mode = hooks.backward_hook_check_if_train_mode()
model = Wrapper.wrap_model(model, 
                           forward_hooks=[check_positive],
                           backward_hooks=[check_train_mode],
                           )

# Do your training! 
for x, y in train_loader:
    pred = model(x)
    loss = loss_fn(pred, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    model.zero_grad()
    
# get stats and analyze them manually
input_stats = model.watcher.input_df
output_stats = model.watcher.output_df

# ...or visualize them with tensorboard
writer = SummaryWriter()
for label, batch_ids, values in model.watcher.iterate_over_stats(inputs=inputs_or_outputs):
    for x, y in zip(batch_ids, values):
        writer.add_scalar(tag=label, scalar_value=y, global_step=x)


# detach the watcher from the model if needed
model = model.detach_hooks()
```
